Timeline
1. PQC Handshake, make it stable
    - Add timing measurement
2. Secure Classical control plane (authentication)
    - Use the shared key to protect classical control messages
    - Message authentication (HMAC)
    - Verify MAC on receive and reject invalid messages
    - Output : authenticated classical messages
    - After PQC handshake, all control messages are authenticated
3. Design Entanglement Establishment Protocol (Protocol Design)
    - Design message flow
    - wrap every classical message with HMAC
    - Sequence diagram
4. Evaluation : With vs Without PQC
    - Implement Baseline + with PQC 
    - Metrics : no. of classical messages, PQC handshake overhead
    - Table of results
5. Extend to Multi-Node/Repeater Scenario
    - Show scalability
    - Perform chained Entanglement establishment / entanglement swapping
    - secure multi-hop control plane 
    - limitations?
6. Failure & attacks
    - Simulate attacker
    - drop messages, modified MAC 
    - show messages are rejected & protocol aborts safely
    - Eavesdropping, MITM
7. Refactoring & architecture cleanup
    - architecture diagram
8. Compare with RSA/ECC (if have time)
9. Report
Control Plane Design = security + coordination rules
Protocol Implementation = entanglement logic and behavior
