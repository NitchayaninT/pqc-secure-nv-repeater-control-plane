# Design and Evaluation of a Post-Quantum Secure Control Plane in Quantum Networks
A self research project exploring the design and performance evaluation of a post-quantum secure classical control plane for quantum networks
## Problem
Current quantum network architectures rely on classical cryptographic schemes such as RSA and ECC to secure the classical control channel. These schemes are vulnerable to future large-scale quantum computers, posing a long-term security risk to quantum network control
## Goal
This project aims to design a post-quantum secure classical control plane for quantum networks by integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The system is evaluated to study performance trade-offs such as latency and communication overhead compared to traditional RSA/ECC based approach
## Software Used : QuNetSim
Why QuNetSim?
QuNetSim is a high-level quantum network simulator designed for developing and testing quantum networking applications and protocols at the network and application layers. It enables rapid prototyping of control and communication protocols without requiring detailed physical-layer modeling. This makes QuNetSim well-suited for this project, which focuses on the design of a post-quantum secure classical control plane and its performance evaluation.
